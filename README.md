Note: the CSV file for the vine_table was too large to upload to Github so I have zipped it and added it to the repository.

# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
We are trying to determine if there is a positivity bias in reviews left on Amazon when the person reviewing the product has been paid by the manufacturer or distributor versus those reviews left by regular consumers purchasing the same products.  You would expect those with a financial interest to be less inclined to criticize a product they were paid to review.  We can compare the summary statistics of the paid and unpaid reviews to look for a significant difference.

For this analysis, I used the sample data set from Amazon on video games.

## Results
